## Part 1: Web Development 101
### 8/23/2021 - 8/27/2021
Was the first week of bootcamp what I expected? Somehow the answer is both yes and no.
Yes in that I knew I'd be facing challenges and blockers since this is so new to me and I definitely have had some struggles getting things to work how I wanted.
But no in that I thought we'd jump right into programming languages, I didn't even think about the stuff you'd need to know beforehand!
Though to be fair, I didn't really know anything about the CLI and how to naivgate that with its various commands or about Github and its usefulness in collaborations but now I do and understand why we'd need a good grasp of these concepts before diving into any language.
