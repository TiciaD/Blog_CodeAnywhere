## Part 1: Web Development 101
### 8/23/2021 - 8/27/2021
Was the first week of bootcamp what I expected? Somehow the answer is both yes and no.
Yes in that I knew I'd be facing challenges and blockers since this is so new to me and I definitely have had some struggles getting things to work how I wanted.
But no in that I thought we'd jump right into programming languages, I didn't even think about the stuff you'd need to know beforehand!
Though to be fair, I didn't really know anything about the CLI and how to naivgate that with its various commands or about Github and its usefulness in collaborations but now I do and understand why we'd need a good grasp of these concepts before diving into any language.

I'm definitely excited to get into programming languages now to get some powerful tools in my belt. That way I can start designing my blog to look as cool as I'm picturing in my head!

I'd like my blog to showcase my education and career journey as well as projects that may personally interest me. Maybe even add links to articles and videos I've found helpful.
